## Notes from the class on 08/27/2020

1.This is the first class of Stats and Vizualization and have started the class with good introductions.
2.It was really interesting to discuss about each others professional career and all being related to data analysis from so many different backgrounds.
3.Known about the things that class serves going forward.
4.Discussed about the survey and how that has been created.
5.Have created the Git Hub and learnt about the organization it offers.
6.To be a successful programmer showcasing the skillset is really important in modern day job market and Git hub simply explains your professional.

### Discussed about the Markdown sheet syntaxes.

1. Headings: To site any headings for the text or to notify something important.
   The font of the headings can be customised by the following sysntaxes.
    1. # H1 - large font
    2. ## H2 - smaller in font than H1 
    3. ### H3 - smaller in font than H2
    
2. Bold : To represent any text in bold format
   - The syntax is **bold text**
  
3. Italic : To represent any text in italics
   - The syntax is *italiczed text*
 
4. Ordered list : To list things in a specific order
   The syntax as follows: 
    1. 1. Item1
    2. 2. Item2
    3. 3. Item3
   
5. Unordered list : To list things that are intended to add inbetween 
   The syantax as follows:
    1. - Item1
    2. - Item2
    3. - Item3
    
 ### Discussed about the cloud platform notebook.ai
 1.Created a test project 
 2.Created a .py file and .ipynb file under the project test
 3.Used the terminal to run the files.
 
 ## Chapter1 Summary
 
## Python for Data Analysis
###Data Wrangling with Pandas, NumPy, and IPython 
      The book is about the python programming you need for the data analysis. The type of data handled here is structured and its in the form of spreadsheets.Python has become one of the most popular interpreted programming language. Among all the interpreted languages Python has become scientific computing language to one of the most important languages for data science, machine learning, and general software development in academia and industry.For data analysis and interactive computing and data visualization, Python will inevitably draw comparisons with other open source and commercial programming languages.n recent years, Python’s improved support for libraries (such as pandas and scikit-learn) has made it a popular choice for data analysis tasks. Combined with Python’s overall strength for general-purpose software engineering, it is an excellent option as a primary language for building data applications. What people are increasingly finding is that Python is a suitable language not only for doing research and prototyping but also for building the production systems this can solve the problems like two language programming in many business applications. 
### Essential Python Libraries:
1. NumPy: Numerical Python provides the data structures, algorithms needed for most scientific applications involving numerical data in Python. It                 provides an efficient ndarray and provides an easy functionality to mathematical operations between arrays.
2. Pandas: Pandas provides high-level data structures and functions designed to make working with structured or tabular data fast, easy, and expressive.           The data manipulation is eased with the pandas it can handle the data structures with labeled axeses and handles both time series and non-time           series data and provides flexibility in handling missing data.
3. matplotlib : It is a popular library for plots and two dimensional visualisations.
4. SciPy : It is a collection of packages of most standard problems ex: scipy.integrate for numerical integrations, scipy.linalg for matrices                        decomposition, scipy.stats for probability and distribution etc.
5. scikit-learn : Offers gneral purpose machine learning toolkit for all kinds of problems of classification, regression, clustering, pre-processing etc.
6. statsmodels : It is a statistical analysis package which is an important part of data science. It focuses on statistical inferences like analysis of                    variance, p-value parameters, visualisation of stat models etc.
### Import conventions for the above discussed libraries
1. import numpy as np
2. import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 
3. import pandas as pd
4. import seaborn as sns
5. import statsmodels as sm
6. import sklearn
